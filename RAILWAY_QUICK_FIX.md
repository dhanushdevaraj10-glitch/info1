# ⚡ RAILWAY CRASH - QUICK FIX (Do This NOW!)

## ✅ What I Just Did

Fixed your app with 3 critical changes:
1. ✅ Added `Procfile` (tells Railway how to start)
2. ✅ Updated `package.json` (specifies Node.js version)
3. ✅ Enhanced `server.js` (better error messages)

**All changes automatically pushed to GitHub!**
